      "question": "How do I tell the system what to extract?",
      "answer": "Type a natural\u2011language instruction (e.g., \u201cCollect product title, price, rating, number of reviews, and image URL\u201d) and optionally provide a schema. The AI identifies the right elements across different layouts and returns structured data."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will it work on complex sites like SPAs or infinite scroll?",
      "answer": "Yes. We use real browser automation to render dynamic content, scroll when needed, click \u201cnext\u201d or \u201cload more,\u201d and handle client\u2011side rendering common in modern SPAs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is web scraping legal and compliant?",
      "answer": "We focus on publicly available data and provide robots-aware crawling, rate limiting, and audit logs. You\u2019re responsible for how you use the service and for complying with applicable laws and site terms. We provide controls to support compliant use, including allowlists and field\u2011level redaction."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate is the AI extraction?",
      "answer": "The AI is trained to locate and structure fields reliably across varied layouts. We add validation, schema enforcement, and confidence checks. You can review samples, set required fields, and fail runs that don\u2019t meet your quality thresholds."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle blocking and reliability?",
      "answer": "Rotating proxies, realistic browser behavior, smart retries, and concurrency controls keep runs stable. You can throttle by domain, set backoff strategies, and monitor success rates with alerts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need engineers to maintain this?",
      "answer": "No. Non\u2011technical users can launch and iterate using plain\u2011language instructions. Data teams can add schemas, transformations, and integrations when needed \u2014 without babysitting brittle selectors."

Trust strip with recognizable logos.\n- Segmentation for a general audience: a simple toggle or cards \u201cNo\u2011code\u201d vs \u201cDeveloper\u201d that switches examples and CTAs (Workflow Builder vs API/SDKs). Keep copy plain-language; reveal complexity progressively.\n- Core narrative (scan-friendly): 1) What it does (3\u2011step: Point \u2192 Extract \u2192 Deliver), 2) Where it works (sites, pagination, auth), 3) Outcomes (clean JSON/CSV to your data warehouse). Use iconography and short bullets.\n- Screens/product proof: Crisp, real screenshots (masked data) with annotations; code samples with tabs (Python, JS, cURL). Show before\u2192after (HTML \u2192 structured JSON) for credibility.\n- Social proof & risk reversal: Ratings, testimonials, usage stats, uptime/SLA, compliance badges; free tier details (\u201cno credit card\u201d), transparent limits.\n- Pricing: Three tiers + enterprise; monthly/annual toggle; highlight most popular. Clarify DaaS vs ETL usage. Include fair-usage notes and overage transparency.\n- Docs & resources: Prominent Docs in nav, instant search, quickstarts by role. \u2018Playground\u2019 link. Comparison page vs common alternatives (manual scraping, other providers).\n- IA & nav: Product, Solutions (by role/use case), Pricing, Docs, Integrations, Resources, Company. Persistent primary CTA in header. Sticky sub\u2011nav on long product pages.\n- In\u2011app patterns: Jobs list with statuses, pipeline builder, connectors marketplace, run history/logs, monitors/alerts, scheduling (cron), retries, dedupe, PII handling, export destinations.\n- Color psychology/utilization: Blue primary (trust/competence) for CTAs/links; purple secondary (AI/innovation) for highlights/gradients; green accent for success and confirmations. Use warm amber for warnings and red for errors (system colors). 60/30/10 distribution; maintain 4.5:1 contrast. Subtle blue\u2192indigo gradient in hero for modern depth.\n- Conversion focus: One dominant CTA per view, repeat inline CTAs after key sections, exit\u2011intent demo invite, frictionless signup (GitHub/Google), progressive profiling post\u2011activation, live chat or sales handoff for enterprise.\n- Grid & responsiveness: 12\u2011col grid, max content width 1200\u20131280px, comfortable gutters. Mobile-first; keep critical CTAs visible; collapse code tabs to dropdown on small screens.\n- Motion: Micro\u2011interactions (hover, press, skeleton loaders). Respect reduced\u2011motion preferences; avoid heavy parallax.\n- Accessibility: WCAG 2.2 AA, visible focus states (3:1), keyboard navigable components, 44\u00d744px targets, descriptive labels/alt text, error prevention and recovery, skip links, language attributes, accessible charts with table fallbacks.",
